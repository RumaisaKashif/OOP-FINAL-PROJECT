### Description
The project utilizes an Object Oriented Programming approach to develop a menstrual cycle tracking program using C++. The program comprises all four stages of the menstrual cycle: follicular, ovulation, luteal, and menstrual. These phases are represented by derived classes of a root class, the 28-day menstrual cycle. The program is designed to offer recommendations for common symptoms experienced during the cycle and track the length of each phase for the monthly cycle.

### Features
- **Symptom Management:** Users can get recommendations for managing various symptoms such as headaches, cramps, fatigue, acne, etc.
- **Phase Data Recording:** Users can record data for each phase of their menstrual cycle, including symptoms and dates.
- **Data Storage:** Recorded data is stored in separate text files for each phase.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application provides a simple and intuitive menu-driven interface for ease of use.

### OOP Utilized
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Friend Function

### Overview
#### 1. Symptom Management
- Choose "Symptom Management" from the main menu.
- Select a symptom from the list and follow the recommendations provided.

#### 2. Phase Data Recording
- Choose the phase for which you want to record data (Follicular, Ovulation, Luteal, or Menstrual).
- Follow the prompts to record symptoms and dates for the selected phase.

#### 3. Exit
- Choose "Exit" from the main menu to quit the application.

### Hurdles
Designing a user interface that effectively incorporates key object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts while enhancing user-friendliness and organization posed significant challenges during the project development.

### Future Improvements
- Include charts and graphs for visualizing menstrual cycle data.
- Implement reminders for upcoming phases and appointments.
- Develop a GUI for a more user-friendly experience.

### Requirements
- C++ compiler (GCC recommended)
- Standard C++ libraries
