# MenTor: Menstrual Cycle Tracking Program
The project utilizes an Object Oriented Programming approach to develop a menstrual cycle tracking program using C++. The program will comprise all four stages of the menstrual cycle: follicular, ovulation, luteal, and menstrual. The phases will be represented by derived classes of a root class (the 28-day menstrual cycle). The program will be designed to offer recommendations to tackle any problems, pertaining to each phase of the cycle, being faced by the user and track the length of each phase for the monthly cycle.
