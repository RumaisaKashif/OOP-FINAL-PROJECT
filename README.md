# MenTor: Menstrual Cycle Tracking Program
The project utilizes an Object Oriented Programming approach to develop a menstrual cycle tracking program using C++. The program will comprise all four stages of the menstrual cycle: follicular, ovulation, luteal, and menstrual. The phases will be represented by derived classes of a root class (the 28-day menstrual cycle). The program is designed to offer recommendations for common symptoms experienced during their cycle and track the length of each phase for the monthly cycle.
